 
If you look beyond the striking appearance of a Red Velvet Cake, you will find that it has a very mild chocolate flavor (it contains just 2 tablespoons (15 grams) of unsweetened cocoa powder. Buttermilk gives this cake its wonderfully moist and tender crumb. Buttermilk has a thick creamy texture with a rich tangy and buttery taste. You can make a good substitute for commercial buttermilk by adding 1 tablespoon of white distilled vinegar, cider vinegar, or lemon juice to 1 cup (240 ml) of milk and letting this mixture sit at room temperature about 10 minutes before using.
