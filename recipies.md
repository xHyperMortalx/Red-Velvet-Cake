I love to frost a Red Velvet Cake with a Cream Cheese Frosting. But the Cream Cheese Frosting I use is a little different than most. What makes it different is that besides cream cheese, it also contains mascarpone cheese and whipped cream. This makes the frosting deliciously rich and creamy. Now, Mascarpone cheese is an Italian cheese that is thick, buttery-rich, delicately sweet and velvety. It is often sold in plastic 8-ounce (227 grams) tubs. You may find it in specialty food stores or in the deli section of your local grocery store. If you cannot find Mascarpone just substitute with 8 ounces (227 grams) of cream cheese. This frosting recipe is adapted from 'The Waldorf-Astoria Cookbook' by John Doherty.
